# ⚽ TeamLookUp

**TeamLookUp** is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to explore football teams and their players. Users can enter the name of their favorite team, and the app fetches a list of all players in that team using a **football API**.  

This project focuses on **JavaScript fundamentals**, **DOM manipulation**, and **API interaction**.
